# LPC1549 LQFP64 TFT with Touch Panel

## Project Start - 15.11.2014 

LPC15xx is a modern Cortex-M3 family with up to 256 kB of flash memory, 32 kB of ROM, a 4 kB EEPROM, and up to 36 kB of SRAM. The peripheral compliment includes one full-speed USB 2.0 device, two SPI interfaces, three USARTs, one Fast-mode Plus I2C-bus interface, one C_CAN module, PWM/timer with four SCTimer.

It's not very fast (72MHz), but it's available in LQFP48, LQFP64 and LQFP100. So it's a very useful to build small CAN devices.
To control or program devices a TFT board is a nice tool, so let's see if we can build one...
