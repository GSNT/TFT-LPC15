# LPC1549 LQFP64 TFT with Touch Panel

## Project Start - 15.11.2014 

LPC15xx is a modern Cortex-M3 family with up to 256 kB of flash memory, 32 kB of ROM, a 4 kB EEPROM, and up to 36 kB of SRAM. The peripheral compliment includes one full-speed USB 2.0 device, two SPI interfaces, three USARTs, one Fast-mode Plus I2C-bus interface, one C_CAN module, PWM/timer with four SCTimer.

It's not very fast (72MHz), but it's available in LQFP48, LQFP64 and LQFP100. So it's very useful to build small CAN devices.
To control or program devices a TFT board is a nice tool, so let's see if we can build one...
